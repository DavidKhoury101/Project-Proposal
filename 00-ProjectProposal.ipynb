    "Online games depend on sustained player engagement to justify whether the ongoing costs of server infrastructure, moderation and updates are worth the price. While publishers regularly shut down games due to a decline in engagement or financial loss, there is no publicly standardized, data-driven threshold for when a game is necessarily considered “dead.” Although decisions are normally framed as business or legal necessities, the supposed “breaking point” for shut down remains vague. This lack of transparency for the audience can cause uncertainty on whether to continue investing their time, money, and resources into an unknown future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies mainly focus on player count trajectories as the main signal of a game’s health. Platforms allow for people to track concurrent player counts over time and can be used to identify sharp falloffs following launch or specific updates. Through the analysis of failed live-service games (Multiversus, whatever we think of), there is a recurring pattern with an early peak followed by a rapid decline. Although there is reason to believe player count alone can capture a game’s potential life, it does not account for whether the remaining players are continuing to engage with the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related work has approached this issue by examining player engagement and churn rather than explicitly defining when a game should be shut down. In Improved Retention Analysis in Freemium Role-Playing Games by Jointly Modelling Players’ Motivation, Progression and Churn, the authors analyze how player motivation, in-game progression, and achievement activity relate to long-term retention.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)Their findings suggest that declining progression and reduced engagement are strong indicators of when players are likely to stop playing altogether, even if the game still maintains an active user base. Similarly, A Data Imputation Strategy to Enhance Online Game Churn Prediction, Considering Non-Login Periods focuses on how extended periods of inactivity can signal permanent disengagement rather than temporary absence. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) By improving how non-login behavior is modeled, the study shows that sustained inactivity is a reliable predictor of churn. While neither study proposes a clear threshold for declaring a game “dead,” both highlight that long-term declines in engagement and progression provide measurable signals of a game’s deterioration beyond what player count alone can capture. \n",

    "Relating to our question, online games can be considered “dead” when player count, achievement completion rate, and reviews all show negative averages over time in relation to peak engagement. Our hypothesis is that games officially shut down by publishers will exhibit similar patterns of declining player count, stagnating achievement progression, and worsening reviews. This will allow us to provide a measurable threshold that can be used to evaluate current online games and their potential. "

    "The ideal dataset would combine data on player activity, engagement, general sentiment, and shutdown outcomes across many online games. The observation would ideally focus on a fixed time interval, like every week or month, to see how trajectories differ between games that failed versus games that remain active. The dataset/s would include multiple categories of variables, a prominent one being player activity metrics. This would focus on the number of average concurrent players, the number of players during* the games’ peak, and monthly active users over time. This information would be critical in determining likely necessary metrics such as the percentage change in player count relative to the historical peak, and player count volatility to see if player count is predictable or not. Another variable would be engagement metrics such as the average playtime per user, the number of achievements and progression milestones being completed, login frequency, and the proportion of returning players vs. new players. Also, churn is a good indicator of seeing the percentage of players inactive and the monthly churn rate. Lastly, sentiment variables, including user reviews and control variables like the monetization model, platform, release data, and major updates, are good indicators for why a game is performing well or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observations would ideally span from each game’s launch until the present or its shutdown, and the dataset would ideally include at least 100 online games, and data being stored in a standardized longitudinal format with CSV files, as this would allow for direct comparison of the variables across games and we will be able to identify reasons for a games shutdown or continued success. We would analyze historical data from both games that have already been shut down, those that are near a shutting down point, and that are healthy, to determine at what point the upkeep of servers is justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of ideal versus real data sets. The following are some tangible data sets that we have been able to uncover, though some specific variables will require more sophisticated gathering or scraping. So, realistically, some variables, such as monetization models, may have to be supplemented with a reasonable estimate given industry standards because that information is not publicly available. However, there are real data sets available for historical data for player counts (particularly on an average user basis per month), user review data, and game update data. There are some limitations with this, such as steam API’s only allowing for so much use at a time, but it should be manageable on a reasonable basis.\n",
